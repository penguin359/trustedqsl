Description: QSL log signing for the Logbook of the World (LoTW)
 Open source libraries and utilities to support using digital signatures
 for amateur radio QSL information.

 A QSL is a confirmation of contact between two amateur radio stations.
 The ARRL Logbook of the World project is a database which collects
 data about contacts between amateur stations (QSOs). This package
 provides the 'tqsl' program for maintaining your digital certificates
 for LoTW and signing and uploading QSO log files.
